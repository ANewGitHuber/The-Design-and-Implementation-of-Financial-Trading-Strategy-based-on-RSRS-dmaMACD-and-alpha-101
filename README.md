Section 1 - Final Choice of Submitted Strategy

A combined strategy will be introduced in this report that incorporates multiple technical analysis approaches, with the primary framework incorporating the Short-term Timing Strategy and the Long-term Momentum Strategy. In this section, we will go through what our strategy accomplishes specifically, how they complement each other synergistically, and how to construct a solid and efficient trading plan.


Section 1.1 About the Strategy

-	Long-term Momentum Strategy

The general idea of this strategy is trend-following over a long period. The main factors are the Simple Moving Average and the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD). Both of these factors need to be satisfied at the same time when determining whether to ensure the accuracy of the strategy entering or exiting a trending market. However, it is significant to introduce a stop loss factor for limit order trading â€“ a "Stochastic Oscillator Indicator".
